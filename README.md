## Croct Application

This time I did a Next.js project using the command:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```
After this I cleanned my project to start the Croct app. To put the server on you can run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This challenge had the goal to integrate a React app whith the Croct plugin to pratice some concepts about personalization. The sandbox which I could use already has the differents contents which I need to show in the application. This way, I created some components to call the home-banner Slot and make the user selection. In the end the content of the page change if we change the user, but I don't now how to personalize the sandbox content to put images or something like this.
