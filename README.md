## About the application

This time I did a Next.js project using
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```
command.<br>

After this I cleanned my project to start the Croct app. So, run
```bash
npm run dev
```
to put the server on.<br>
This challenge has the goal to integrate a React app whith the Croct plugin to pratice some concepts about personalization. The sandbox which I could use already has the differents contents which I need to show in the application. This way, I create some components to call the home-banner Slot and make the user selection. In the end the content of the page change if we change the user, but I don't now how to personalize the sandbox content to put images or something like this.
